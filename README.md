# NeoVim Personal Setup

I've been experimenting with this for a while now. I’ve always enjoyed Lua scripting,
dating back to my days of creating World of Warcraft add-ons, though that’s a story for
another time. NeoVim has become my go-to text editor, transformed into a full-fledged
IDE through plugins, and it’s what I rely on for my daily work. To me, coding is like a
craft, where the tools you choose—just like a painter carefully selecting brushes and
colors to suit their style—are the ones that make you feel the most at ease.
