# NeoVim Personal Setup

This is something that I've been tinkering for a while. I like Lua scripting, from the
old days of working on World of Warcraft add-ons, but that's another story. So, NeoVim
has been my personal choice of a text-editor, turned into and IDE through plug-ins, that
I really use as day to day workin tools. I believe coding is a craft discipline in which
you use the tools you feel most comfortable with, like a painter whose brushes and paints
are chosen carefully to match his art style.
